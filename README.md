## Overview

### The challenge
The ATM Interface project simulates a basic Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system, enabling users to perform essential banking operations such as checking their transaction history, withdrawing funds, and depositing money. The challenge was to create a console-based application that is both functional and user-friendly, while implementing key programming concepts and ensuring data integrity.

## My process

### Built with
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **File I/O**: To handle reading from and writing to files for transaction history.
- **Java Util Package**: For utilities like `Scanner` and `LocalDateTime`.
- **Exception Handling**: To manage and respond to runtime errors gracefully.

### What I learned
Through the development of this ATM Interface, I gained significant insights and experience in:
- **File Handling**: Learning how to read from and write to files in Java to maintain a persistent transaction history.
- **User Input Validation**: Implementing input validation to ensure the application handles invalid or unexpected user inputs gracefully.
- **Modular Programming**: Structuring the program into separate classes (e.g., `History`, `Withdraw`, `Deposit`) to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Exception Handling**: Managing exceptions effectively to prevent the application from crashing and to provide useful feedback to users.

### Continued development
Future improvements and additions to this project could include:
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Transitioning from a console-based application to a GUI-based application for better user experience.
- **Database Integration**: Using a database to store user information and transaction history instead of text files, enhancing data security and scalability.
- **Additional Features**: Adding functionalities like account creation, password management, and more detailed transaction records.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implementing advanced security measures such as encryption to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
